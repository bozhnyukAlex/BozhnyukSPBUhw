          what was annotated on the genome
      added CDS feature to organelle proteins
      coded_by to range on the RefSeq transcripts instead of scaffolds
      corrected CDS range (if different than the genome length)
      removed 'Derived by automated computational analysis using gene prediction 
      removed /inference and /exception on CDS
      removed some db_xrefs that are present on genome but missing on known RefSeq (NP_s)
      used native known RefSeq markup for gene names and such when they differ from 
  * corrected CDS feature annotation, including:
  * corrected DBSOURCE to RefSeq transcripts instead of scaffolds
  * removed unexpected PUBLICATIONS propagated from the scaffolds

The protein.gbk.gz file in the protein directory was regenerated to correct an error 
in the source for the protein (DBSOURCE and coded_by fields). For some proteins, the 
scaffold on which the protein is annotated was used as the source rather than the 
transcript. The full list of changes includes:
